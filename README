Very powerful serialization for Javascript.
This is similar to Rather Insane Serialization, but supports an even wider
array of features. This library adds support for prototype-based class
hierarchies and, in many cases, lexical closures. It uses a semi-stateful
stream interface to eliminate redundant communication for RPC applications.
