Mediocre serialization for Javascript.
This library is basically a port of Rather Insane Serialization to Caterwaul.
It serializes things using stateful streams, which construct references for
opaque objects and can later resolve those references. For example:

d = document.createElement('div')
stream = caterwaul.serialization()
s = stream({dom_node: d})
decoded = stream.decode(s)
decoded.dom_node === d          // returns true

It uses this technique when encoding objects whose prototypes are unknown.
